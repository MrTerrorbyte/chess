There are two custom pieces, cannon and threeleaper. Cannon looks like an upside down pawn and threeleaper looks like an upside down rook (I was too lazy to find/make pictures). If you know how to play chinese chess, then you know how the cannon works. It can move vertically and horizontally like a rook, but it can only capture pieces behind another piece. In other words, there must be one piece in the middle. Threeleaper can also move horizontally and vertically, but it always has to move by 3 squares.
